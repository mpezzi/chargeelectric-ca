GFCI Outlets help protect you from electrical hazards by monitoring the amount of electricity flowing in a circuit, and causing a trip if an imbalance is detected. GFCI outlets are used in areas where risk of electrical shock is great, such as the kitchen, bathroom and garage. GFCI outlets are required in:

* Spa and pool areas
* Home Exterior
* Bathrooms
* Garages
* Kitchen
* Crawlspaces and unfinished basements
* Wetbars
* Laundry and utility sinks
