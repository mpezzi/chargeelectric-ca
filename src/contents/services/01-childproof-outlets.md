Child proof outs appear identical to standard electrical outlets but instead have a spring loaded cover which prevents the insertion of an object when unequal pressure is applied to the receptacles openings.

With standard outlets, accidents often occur when the child inserts a common house hold item into the outlet such as:

* Paperclips
* Utensils
* Keys
* Jewelry
* Scissors
* Hairpins
* And just about anything they can get their hands on

Call Charge Electric today to install the peace of mind that comes with having child proof outlets.
