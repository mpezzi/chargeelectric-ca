Pot lights are becoming a must in most renovations due to their decorative and modern look. Pot lights are used for a number of applications such as:

* Accent lighting
* Spotlighting for art or design pieces
* Task lighting for functional purposes such as kitchen or bathroom
* Wall-washing to provide a visual punch and make the room appear larger
* Versatility with dimmers to help provide mood lighting
