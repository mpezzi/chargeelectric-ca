When planning a home renovation itâ€™s best to speak with a qualified electrician about implications on your homes electrical systems.

Charge Electric will work directly with the Electrical Safety Authority (E.S.A.) to obtain permits, inspections and certificates ensuring your home is safe and compliant under electrical regulations.

Under current regulation, only a licensed electrician can legally be hired to do electrical work in your home.
