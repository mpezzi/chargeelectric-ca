As technology advances so does the electrical power required to maintain safe and continuous service on high-demand circuits. By upgrading your building circuitry you not only ensure continuous uninterrupted power, but significantly reduce the risk of electrical fire.

How will I know if I need an upgraded circuit?

Are your circuit breakers tripping on a regular basis? An electrical circuit will trip when the amperage across the electrical wire is more than the circuit breaker can handle. Breaker tripping can also occur with faulty, loose connections or corroded terminals. If a breaker is tripping on a regular basis, it may become unreliable over time in its ability to stop power through the circuit when overloaded potentially leading to wires melting or even catching fire.
